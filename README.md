## About

SybilShield is an open-source project built for the StarkNet ecosystem that utilizes blockchain data to detect Sybil attack behaviors.

A Sybil attack is a type of attack where an attacker creates multiple fake identities (also known as Sybil nodes) in a network in order to gain control or disrupt the network's operation.

SybilShield is implemented using:
- Apibara technology to explore on-chain data
- Python to detect and mitigate Sybil attacks by identifying and isolating fake identities
- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs)
- D3 Force to render the data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Run the [backend](https://github.com/carbonable-labs/sybil-shield)
Add .env with BACKEND_URL={URL of your backend}

##### Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

##### Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.


## Roadmap
